## 👩🏻‍💻 About the project

During the 6-week [Chingu] (https://www.chingu.io/) Voyage 45 in August and September 2023, this app was created. The program utilizes data from the NASA open API (https://data.nasa.gov/resource/gh4g-9sfh.json). This extensive data set comprises details on every known meteorite landing, according to the NASA Open Data Portal.

The goals for this project included:

- Utilizing NASA data to develop a front-end-only application.
- Using Javascript, html, css, other developing tool, or any other libraries to create the app's plans, designs, and code.
- Strictly avoid using AI-based solution generators like GitHub CoPilot in the app's development.
- To create a minimum viable product (MVP) that has a landing page with the following information:
  - The history of meteorite strikes is displayed in a detail data display.
  - Users' ability to modify a particular data display using search fields
  - A component of summary metrics that visualizes the data

Our team had goals for the application's functionality as well as for gaining experience working with a global, remote team of developers and an UI/UX designer:

- To try learning required languages and tools to build the application.
- To coordinate the work of a global, remote team of developers and UI/UX designers.
